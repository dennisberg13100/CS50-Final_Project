# CS50 - Final Project

This final project is made with the goal to get graduated in the CS50 computer science course. In the project we were free to create a project of our own, using any one of the languages that we've learnt at the course. It should be something that solves an actual problem of our community.

## My project - Frontend Sandbox

When we're creating a html page using a IDE we have to change to another browser tab and refresh the page the whole time to see what the page looks like and to check if there are no bugs. On my Frontend Sandbox it will be possible to see the changes on the pages while we are writing our code without changing the pages and refreshing them. You are going to be able to see the results right away.

The community that I chose to program for is our CS50 community that took the Web path. It will be created using just html, css and javascript (with jQuey, a javaScript libery). I have the intention to publish this program on github and github page. It will be possible for the community to use it online or even to clone the repository and use it on their on computer.

I will also publish it under MIT license, that allows all the people to use and change my program how ever they want or need to. The user can even make use of it as a part of their own program if they want so.
